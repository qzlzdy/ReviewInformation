`sound` [n] 声音 | [adj] 甜美的

### 1.2.4 主谓双宾 & 主谓宾宾补

## 1.3 句子的成分（词性）

### 1.3.1 谓语

#### 1.3.1.1 谓语的成分

有时态的实义动词或系动词

> Note：
> - 谓语只能是动词

> - 所有不作谓语的动词变成非谓语动词

#### 1.3.1.2 动词能不能多

一句话中只能有一个动词，且充当谓语，多余的动词变成非谓语动词

> 动词变非谓语动词方法：
> 1. `-ing` 主动
> 2. `-ed` 被动
> 3. `to do` 目的

#### 1.3.1.3 动词能不能少

一句话中必须有动词，当一句话需要动词而没有动词时，加`be`动词，且`be`动词无意

#### 1.3.1.4 谓语的总结

一句话中有且只有一个有时态的实义动词或系动词存在，并且充当谓语。

> > 三种情况无被动：
> > 1. 动词后有介词时，动词无被动
> > 2. 系动词无被动
> > 3. `have`表“有”时，无被动

- 所有不会的先写成简单句，一定保证语法正确
- 所有不会的单词写成会的词汇

### 1.4.2 长难句

长难句分析第一步：找谓语（动词），从而找到主谓宾。如果有多个动词，就找主句的谓语动词（没有引导词的）

```

# 二、并列句

## 2.1 什么是并列句

用连词连接两个句子

## 2.2 常见的并列连词

- 平行：`and`, `not only···but also···`
  - `similarly`, `equally`, `likewsie`, `at the same time`, `in the meanwhile`

## 2.3 并列句的考点分析

### 2.3.1 写作

- 只要上下句间有逻辑关系，就一定要用逻辑关系词（连词、副词、介词和介词短语）
- 使用连词时，可以加逗号，可以不加
- 其他逻辑关系词前，要么加句号，要么加`and`

### 2.3.2 完形

- 只需读懂逻辑关系词上下句的意思

### 2.3.3 长难句

长难句分析第二步：找连词，但是连词连接两个单词时不考虑。

- 只要见到并列连词，通常都有省略

> 查找省略内容的方法
> - 只要有省略，一定省略在连词后
> - 连词后有的成分连词前**通常**有
> - 连词前有而连词后没有的成分便是省略的内容
> - 如果连词后只有一个成分，连词前一定能找到它的对应成分
> - 如果连词后有多个成分，连词前不一定都能找到，但至少找到一个

> 代词指代题的方法
> - 就近原则：跟谁近就可能指谁
> - 一致原则：意思要一致

# 三、名词和名词性从句

## 3.1 名词能充当什么成分

- 主语
- 宾语
- 表语
- 同位语

### 3.1.1 同位语

用来解释名词的成分就是同位语

只要在作文中见到名词，都可以有意识地加同位语，对该命名词补充说明（1~2次）

#### 3.1.1.1 同位语的成分

- 名词
- 代词
- 非谓语动词
- 从句

```
Persistence, an active mentality, plays a critical role in the glorious of all children and adults.
```

## 3.2 名词性从句是什么

能够充当名词的从句

## 3.3 名词性从句的引导词

名词性从句的引导词是按照从句的类型分为以下三类：

- `that`：陈述句。且`that`不充当任何成分，没有意思
- `whether`：一般疑问句。且`whether`不充当任何成分，意思是是否
- 特殊疑问词：特殊疑问句。

所有从句一定是陈述句，即**引导词+主语+谓语**

```

```

## 3.4 名词性从句的考点分析

### 3.4.1 写作

写作满分句型：

- 主语从句
- 同位语从句

#### 3.4.1.1 主语从句

- 主语从句放在句末，`it`作形式主语
- `It is apparent that ···`，众所周知
- `It looks beyong dispute that ···`，众所周知
- `It has been widely accepted that ···`，众所周知
- `It is universally acknowledged that ···`，众所周知
- `It keeps my argument that ···`，我觉得

主语从句的满分句型可以写在作文中任何一句话前面，用来拉长句子

#### 3.4.1.2 同位语从句

```

```

### 3.4.2 长难句

能够识别各个名词性从句，并且通顺地翻译出来

#### 3.4.2.1 如何识别主语从句

只要见到引导词在句首，且从句后没有被逗号隔开，一定是主语从句。主语从句从句首后开始，到主句谓语动词前结束

此外，`It···that`通常都是主语从句，主语从句从`that`开始，到句末结束

```
That the plates are moving is now beyong dispute.

```

#### 3.4.2.2 如何识别宾语从句

只要实义动词后有引导词，就暂定为宾语从句~~状语从句~~

`if`只能引导宾语从句，`whether`可以引导所有从句

```

```

#### 3.4.2.3 如何识别表语从句

系动词后有引导词，就是表语从句

```

只要名词后有引导词，就暂定为同位语从句（更可能是定语从句）

# 四、定语和定语从句

## 4.1 什么是定语

听到**······的 + 名词**，**······的**就是修饰这个名词的定语

## 4.2 定语的成分

- 形容词
- 名词
- 介词短语
- 非谓语动词
- 从句

## 4.3 定语的位置

前小后大：一个单词修饰名词时**通常**放在名词前，多个单词修饰名词时**通常**放在名词后

```

```

## 4.4 定语从句

### 4.4.1 定语从句的构成

名词+引导词+句子

### 4.4.2 定语从句引导词

定语从句的引导词按照先行词的种类分为以下5类：

- 人：`who`, `whom`, `whose`
- 物：`that`, `which`, `whose`
- 时间：`that`, `which`, `when`
- 地点：`that`, `which`, `where`
- 原因：`that`, `which`, `why`

> 谁决定引导词的用法？
>
> 1. 先行词
>
> 2. 引导词在从句中充当的成分
>
> 共同决定了引导词用法

定语从句引导词按引导词词性分为以下3类：

- 代词（主语、宾语）：`that`, `which`, `who`, `whom`
- 副词（NULL）：`where`, `when`, `why`
- 形容词（修饰最近的名词）：`whose`

```

```

## 4.5 定语从句的特殊用法

- `that`引导定语从句时，如果充当宾语，可以省略。分析长难句时，如果见到有两个名词相邻，通常都是省略了`that`的定语从句
- 区别限制和非限制性定语从句
- 如果先行词和引导词之间有介词，只能用`whom`或`which`
- 区别`the same ··· as`, `the same ··· that`引导的定语从句
- `as`和`which`引导的非限制性定语从句，`which`引导的可以修饰整个句子，`as`也可以，但是`which`只能放在主句 后，`as`可前可后

## 4.6 区别定语从句与同位语从句

- 相同点：先行词+引导词+句子

- 不同点：

  - 看从句本身意思，定语从句修饰名词，同位语名词解释名词
  - 看引导词`that`是否充当从句成分，充当了是定语从句，没有充当是同位语从句
  - 定语的先行词可以是所有名词，同位语从句的先行词只能是抽象名词
  - 定语从句引导词有8个，同位语同位语从句一般都是`that`

## 4.7 定语从句的至难点

寻找先行词

> 如何寻找先行词--必须读懂这句话
>
> - 定语从句的先行词就是离它最近的那个名词
> - 定语从句的先行词是它前面的几个并列名词
> - 定语从句的先行词是它前面的一个从句
> - 定语从句的先行词是它前面的整个句子
> - 定语从句的先行词和引导词被隔开了

## 4.8 定语从句的考点分析

### 4.8.1 写作

```

 ### 4.8.2 英汉差异对比

- 汉语意合，英语形合
  - 句子结构

  - 逻辑关系词
- 汉语多主动，英语多被动
- 汉语多短句，英语多长句

> 合并短句的方法
>
> - 非谓语动词
> - 加连词
> - 从句

能够找到一句话当中的定语成分，并通顺地翻译出来

**关键找名词**，只要名词后有一坨东西，只要不是动词就暂定是定语~~状语~~，定语从名词后开始，到主句谓语动词前结束。如果定语在主句谓语动词后，定语从名词后开始，通常到句末结束，如果定语后有连词，到连词前结束。大定语中可能有若干小定语，每个小定语到下一个名词后结束，但是固定搭配除外
