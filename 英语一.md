- 所有不会的单词写成会的词汇

### 1.4.2 长难句

## 2.3 并列句的考点分析

### 2.3.1 写作

- 只要上下句间有逻辑关系，就一定要用逻辑关系词（连词、副词、介词和介词短语）
- 使用连词时，可以加逗号，可以不加
- 其他逻辑关系词前，要么加句号，要么加`and`

### 2.3.2 完形

- 只需读懂逻辑关系词上下句的意思

### 2.3.3 长难句

长难句分析第二步：找连词，但是连词连接两个单词时不考虑。

- 只要见到并列连词，通常都有省略

> 查找省略内容的方法
> - 只要有省略，一定省略在连词后
> - 连词后有的成分连词前**通常**有
> - 连词前有而连词后没有的成分便是省略的内容
> - 如果连词后只有一个成分，连词前一定能找到它的对应成分
> - 如果连词后有多个成分，连词前不一定都能找到，但至少找到一个

> 代词指代题的方法
> - 就近原则：跟谁近就可能指谁
> - 一致原则：意思要一致

- 主语
- 宾语
- 表语
- 同位语

### 3.1.1 同位语

- 名词
- 代词

## 3.2 名词性从句是什么

能够充当名词的从句

## 3.3 名词性从句的引导词

名词性从句的引导词是按照从句的类型分为以下三类：

- `that`：陈述句。且`that`不充当任何成分，没有意思
- `whether`：一般疑问句。且`whether`不充当任何成分，意思是是否
- 特殊疑问词：特殊疑问句。

所有从句一定是陈述句，即**引导词+主语+谓语**

```

写作满分句型：

- 主语从句

### 3.4.2 长难句

能够识别各个名词性从句，并且通顺地翻译出来

#### 3.4.2.1 如何识别主语从句

只要见到引导词在句首，且从句后没有被逗号隔开，一定是主语从句。主语从句从句首后开始，到主句谓语动词前结束

此外，`It···that`通常都是主语从句，主语从句从`that`开始，到句末结束

```

```

#### 3.4.2.2 如何识别宾语从句

只要实义动词后有引导词，就暂定为宾语从句~~状语从句~~

```
